## 👁️​​🧱 ​​Raycasting and DDA

**Raycasting** is the **core rendering technique** used in this project, allowing us to create a **3D perspective from a 2D map** by casting rays from the player's position and calculating their intersections with walls. This method is **efficient for rendering simple 3D environments** and is the basis for many classic games like **Wolfenstein 3D** and **Doom**. It uses **mathematical concepts** such as **trigonometry and geometry** to determine how rays interact with the environment, enabling the engine to render **walls, floors, ceilings, and textures in real time**.

### ​DDA Algorithm

The **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)** algorithm is a method for calculating the intersection of rays with a grid-based map, which is **essential for raycasting**.This allows the engine to efficiently determine where rays hit walls and how to render them on screen, making it a **fundamental part of the raycasting process**.

- **Grid-based only**: Works exclusively in **discrete and Euclidean spaces**; not suitable for continuous or complex geometries.
- **Efficient complexity**: Reduces complexity to **O(1) per step**, though total steps can be high for large maps or long walls—**without precision loss**.
- **Multi-step process**: Consists of several sequential steps to trace the ray through the grid.

### Fish-eye correction and distance calculations

When textures are disabled, the engine can switch between **Euclidean distance** (straight-line distance from player to wall) and **perpendicular distance** (distance along the ray's path). The latter is used for **fish-eye correction**, which eliminates distortion by ensuring that walls appear straight regardless of the viewing angle, providing a more realistic perspective.

## 🔥 Boost mode implementation

When boost mode is enabled, low-level optimizations are applied to critical render loops and buffer filling operations, achieving **performance improvements of up to 2.5x in frame rate**. 

### What are hot loops and low-level optimizations?

When rendering an image, there are certain functions that are called **once per pixel**. For example, in a window of **1280 × 720 pixels**, a function would be called around **900,000 times per frame**. These highly-repeated loops are called **hot loops**.

Hot loops are loops that execute millions of times per second in performance-critical code across **graphics engines**, **real-time simulations**, **physics**, **machine learning**, and **data processing systems**. Because they run so frequently, every CPU cycle counts, small inefficiencies drastically reduce performance and optimizing hot loops is essential for achieving high FPS rates in realtime applications.



### ❌ Things to Avoid in hot loops

| Optimization | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Pointer indirections** | Causes cache misses, breaks prefetching, increases RAM latency |
| **Frequent cache misses** | Reduce throughput, fill pipelines with NOPs, cause stalls |
| **`if` statements in hot loops** | Unpredictable branches can hurt branch prediction and pipeline efficiency; deterministic input may still be OK |
| **Function pointers** | Increase call overhead and cache misses; worse than deterministic `if`s |
| **Misaligned multiplications** | Misaligned memory accesses → inefficient, more cache misses, reduces vectorization |
| **Function calls** | Stack/register overhead, breaks pipeline optimization, reduces vectorization |
| **Calls saturating the I-cache** | Many scattered instructions → lower throughput, I-cache pressure |
| **Heavy divisions and multiplications** | Slow operations → may stall hot loops |


### ✅ Things to Encourage in hot loops

| Optimization | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Memory alignment** | Enables contiguous and predictable access, reduces cache misses, supports SIMD and vectorization |
| **Contiguous memory / Struct of Arrays (SoA)** | Facilitates prefetching, efficient cache line loading, enables SIMD and vectorization |
| **Prefetching** | Brings data into cache ahead of time, keeps pipeline full, supports vectorization and SIMD |
| **SIMD** | Processes multiple data elements per instruction, increases throughput, requires aligned and contiguous data |
| **Vectorization** | Converts scalar operations into block operations, depends on alignment, contiguity, and prefetching |
| **Loop unrolling** | Reduces loop control overhead, allows SIMD/vectorization to be more effective |
| **Use of registers and local variables** | Reduces memory accesses, keeps data close to the CPU, accelerates hot loops and vectorization |
| **Microprocessor performance improvements** | Takes advantage of modern CPU enhancements like larger caches, better branch prediction, higher clock speeds, and SIMD/vector units |

### Memory Fill Optimizations
Instead of writing memory byte-by-byte, this implementation fills memory using **larger aligned blocks** that match cache lines and pages, allowing modern CPUs to write much faster. By **aligning the destination pointer**, **expanding the fill value** into larger patterns, and writing progressively smaller blocks only when needed, this approach reduces write operations and improves CPU and cache efficiency.

> **Note:** 📝 More on Memory Fill: [Our Notion article](https://broken-snowdrop-f03.notion.site/Mejoras-de-bufferizacion-2fdb80eb3d8880d08f50d5f284dd28c8?pvs=74).

| Optimization | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Memory alignment** | Aligns the destination pointer to 64-byte cache line boundaries to avoid unaligned writes and cache penalties. |
| **Pattern expansion** | Expands the input `int` value into `long` and `long long` patterns to write multiple bytes per instruction. |
| **Large block writes** | Fills memory using the largest possible blocks first (4 KB pages, 64-bit, 32-bit, then bytes). |
| **Loop unrolling** | Unrolls inner loops to reduce branching overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism. |
| **Cache & TLB efficiency** | Page-sized writes improve cache utilization and reduce TLB misses. |
| **Linear control flow** | Uses a single iterative flow to minimize function calls and branch mispredictions. |
| **Tail handling** | Handles remaining bytes with progressively smaller writes to ensure correctness. |

## Minimap

To render the minimap, a **2D scaling relationship** is established between the window's pixel matrix dimensions and the map's grid dimensions. This scaling is then applied to each point drawn on the minimap, leveraging **2D set rendering logic** to efficiently map world coordinates to screen space. This approach involves:

- **Grid-to-screen transformation**: Converting map grid positions to minimap screen coordinates using the scaling factor
- **Set-based filtering**: Efficiently filtering map cells to determine visibility within the minimap bounds
- **Coordinate clamping**: Ensuring all rendered points remain within valid screen boundaries


### Implementation Details

- **Cell type detection**: Each scaled point is checked to determine if it belongs to a wall or floor cell
- **Color assignment**: Walls and floors are rendered with distinct colors for clarity
- **Dynamic translation**: Points are translated based on zoom level and player position to keep the player centered
- **Ray visualization**: Rays are drawn using the same scale and translation as the map, with a distinctive color for differentiation
- **Adaptive rendering**: The minimap adjusts dynamically to window size and map dimensions while maintaining spatial accuracy and visual clarity


> **Note:** 📝 More on 2D rendering sets and minimap: [Our Notion article](https://broken-snowdrop-f03.notion.site/Renderizado-de-imagenes-2D-y-minimapa-2fab80eb3d8880f88e56f189f2cde9e7?pvs=74).



## Mouse

Mouse control is implemented by capturing mouse movement events and translating them into camera rotation. The system prioritizes **low-latency, consistent input handling** independent of window size:

- **Pixel clamping**: Mouse movement is clamped to a maximum pixel delta per frame, ensuring consistent rotation speed regardless of window dimensions. This approach mirrors modern shooter games, providing predictable camera control.

- **Center reset**: The mouse cursor is repositioned to the screen center after each frame, preventing the player's wrist from leaving the mousepad and improving user comfort during extended play sessions.

- **Configurable sensitivity**: Mouse sensitivity is fully adjustable to suit individual player preferences, allowing fine-tuning of rotation responsiveness.

- **Toggle control**: Mouse look can be enabled or disabled with **J**, allowing players to switch between mouse and keyboard control as needed.

- **Polling-based tracking**: Mouse position is polled every frame rather than handled through MiniLibX event hooks. This approach reduces input latency, as event queue latency can exceed frame rate timing, preventing jitter and stutter. Clamping mouse delta per frame ensures smooth, consistent rotation.
